		<!-- Step 1:
			Include jQuery, Here the jQuery is included with in js directory,
		    Thus the relative path for the file becomes ../../../js/jquery-min.js.

		    IMPORTANT NOTE:
		    Backbone.JS has light dependence on jQuery for DOM manipulation.
		-->
		<script src="../../../js/jquery-min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

		<!-- Step 2:
			Include Underscore, Here the Underscore is included with in js directory,
			Thus the relative path for the file becomes ../../../js/underscore-min.js

			IMPORTANT NOTE:
			Underscore.js should always included before Backbone.JS.
			else Browser console will show error, because Backbone’s only dependency is Underscore.js
		-->
		<script src="../../../js/underscore-min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

		<!-- Step 3:
			Include JSON2, Here the JSON2 is included with in js directory,
			Thus the relative path for the file becomes ../../../js/json2.js

			IMPORTANT NOTE:
			json2.js should always included for JSON support for older browsers.
		-->
		<script src="../../../js/json2.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

		<!-- Step 4:
			Include Backbone, Here the Backbone is included with in js directory,
			Thus the relative path for the file becomes ../../../js/backbone.js
		-->
		<script src="../../../js/backbone-min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

		<!-- Step 5:
			Include example-main-1.js, Here the example-main-1.js is included with in js directory,
			Thus the relative path for the file becomes example-main-1.js.

			NOTE: example-main-1.js is custom user defined file.
			You can change its name as per your requirements.

			example-main-1.js is where your application begins.
			You should customize it in order to initialize your views, models, collections and routers.
