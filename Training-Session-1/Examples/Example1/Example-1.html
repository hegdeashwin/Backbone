		<!-- Step 1:
			Include jQuery, Here the jQuery is included with in js directory,
		    Thus the relative path for the file becomes ../../../js/jquery-min.js.

		    IMPORTANT NOTE: 
		    Backbone.JS has light dependence on jQuery for DOM manipulation.	
		-->
		<script src="../../../js/jquery-min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

		<!-- Step 2: 
			Include Underscore, Here the Underscore is included with in js directory,
			Thus the relative path for the file becomes ../../../js/underscore-min.js

			IMPORTANT NOTE: 
			Underscore.js should always included before Backbone.JS.
			else Browser console will show error, because Backbone’s only dependency is Underscore.js 
		-->	
		<script src="../../../js/underscore-min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

		<!-- Step 3: 
			Include JSON2, Here the JSON2 is included with in js directory,
			Thus the relative path for the file becomes ../../../js/json2.js	

			IMPORTANT NOTE: 
			json2.js should always included for JSON support for older browsers.
		-->
		<script src="../../../js/json2.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
		
		<!-- Step 4: 
			Include Backbone, Here the Backbone is included with in js directory,
			Thus the relative path for the file becomes ../../../js/backbone.js			
		-->
		<script src="../../../js/backbone-min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

		<!-- Step 5: 
			Include apps.js, Here the apps.js is included with in js directory, 
			Thus the relative path for the file becomes apps.js.	

			NOTE: apps.js is custom user defined file. 
			You can change its name as per your requirements.

			apps.js is where your application begins. 
			You should customize it in order to initialize your views, models, collections and routers.
